# Project Description
Report potential performance issues and possible remedies for a given
executable.

SCA will non-destructively instrument the executable and run the
instrumented version, collecting performance data. Upon completion,
a report will be presented listing any detected issues with possible
remedies.

IMPORTANT: To use SCA the binary must be linked with relocation
information preserved, which is not the default linker behavior.
Add "-q" or "--preserve-relocs" to the "ld" command or "-Wl,-q"
or "-Wl,--preserve-relocs" if the compiler is used to link."

Source Code Advisor (SCA) and Feedback-Directed Program Restructuring (FDPR)
work together to allow you to analyze and optimize your applications.

FDPR works similarly to a compiler: it reads a linked executable program and
produces an optimized version of it. Both regular executable and shared library
forms are supported. The optimization uses an execution profile, collected by
running an instrumented version of the input.

During the code optimization process, FDPR produces a journal of the optimizations
performed. The Source Code Advisor uses this journal, produced as an XML file,
to highlight potential problems in your source code and to offer suggested solutions.
The journal explains each optimization site, including the source location,
execution count, the performance problem found, and the user action required to
resolve the problem. It is important to select a representative workload for
both SCA and for FDPR so that the optimization step is effective.

Because SCA uses information gathered by FDPR, knowledge of this tool is important.

The combination of SCA and FDPR provide you with two major approaches to performance
analysis and optimization:

* Find and visualize performance problems in the source program using feedback-directed analysis.

* Perform feedback-directed optimization of an executable program (or a shared library).
